## Introduction

Welcome to ResumeRevealer, a project developed by Team Artificial Coders during the MINeD 2024 hackathon. In a fast-paced 48-hour coding challenge, our team used their skills and creativity to create a Python-based tool that parses resumes, extracts relevant skills and details, providing a excellent solution for recruiters and job seekers.
